  <b>CDC Flow API Service Metrics Flow</b>
  
  The system has two primary metrics flows:
  
  1. <b>Service Metrics:</b> Pod metrics for determining flow health status
     - Source timestamp metrics (grpc_in)
     - Destination timestamp metrics (syslog_out, http_out)
     - Error metrics for all pods
  
  2. <b>API Metrics:</b> Service performance metrics
     - Request counts
     - Request durations
     - Error counts
