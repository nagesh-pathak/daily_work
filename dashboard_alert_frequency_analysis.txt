OBSERVATIONS:
=============
1. Most alerts use either 1-minute or 5-minute evaluation frequencies
2. Immediate alerts (for: 0m) are typically used for service down conditions
3. Resource-based alerts (CPU, Memory, Disk) consistently use 5m frequency with 1m for duration
4. On-premise alerts generally have longer evaluation periods than cloud alerts
5. The most critical alert (Unhealthy Pods Persist) has the longest evaluation cycle (15m frequency, 1h for duration)
6. Pod restart and service down alerts typically fire immediately (for: 0m) to ensure rapid notification
7. Performance and threshold-based alerts use moderate for durations (1-5m) to avoid false positives
