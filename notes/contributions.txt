Business Requirement
Allow multiple flows to same destination IP and destination type

Challenges
- Existing system limitation preventing multiple flows to same destination
- Customer requests for flexible flow configuration to same destination IP
- Need to support different IPs with same destination type from NIOS source

Solution/Contribution
Added functionality so that customers should be able to create multiple number of flows to same destination IP, and also to different IP but same destination type from NIOS source

Business Requirement
Create observability for CDC (Cloud Data Connector) infrastructure

Challenges
- Lack of unified monitoring across CDC OnPrem infrastructure
- Need for real-time resource monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Requirement for proactive monitoring and rapid incident response
- Customer SLA monitoring and compliance needs

Solution/Contribution
Built a unified monitoring dashboard for CDC OnPrem infrastructure:
- Created real-time monitoring for CPU, Memory, and Disk usage with configurable thresholds
- Implemented alert system for proactive monitoring and rapid incident response
- Built trend analysis for resource usage growth
- Created customer summary statistics showing:
  * Total CDC customers
  * Active vs Inactive hosts
  * BloxOne vs NIOS source distribution
- Developed specialized dashboards for events monitoring and flow status tracking

This improved CDC infrastructure visibility and enables proactive monitoring of resource utilization across the entire CDC OnPrem infrastructure.

Business Requirement
Create SLI/SLO for CDC services

Challenges
- Need for structured, measurable monitoring capabilities
- Requirement to support business objectives and operational requirements
- Lack of baseline metrics across CDC services
- Need for organized service monitoring structure

Solution/Contribution
Created SLI/SLO's which significantly enhances CDC operational excellence:
- Established baseline metrics covering 50+ SLI indicators across CDC services
- Reorganized metrics into 6 Business Services:
  * CDC OnPrem Service: Infrastructure Monitoring, Host Management, Container Operations
  * CDC Flow Service: Flow Management, Data Processing
  * CDC Service: Customer Management, Service Health, Performance Monitoring, Feature Analytics
  * CDC API Service: API Performance
  * CDC Capacity Service: Capacity Planning
  * CDC Cloud Service: Container Health, Infrastructure Availability, Network Performance, Monitoring Operations, Operational Stability, Security

Business Requirement
Create architectural diagrams for better understanding of CDC components & services

Challenges
- Complex CDC infrastructure requiring clear documentation
- Need for development team understanding of component boundaries
- Operations team requirements for deployment and troubleshooting guidance
- Cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing needs

Solution/Contribution
Created comprehensive architectural diagrams for CDC Infrastructure:

For Development Teams:
- Clear Component Boundaries: Understanding service responsibilities
- API Contract Clarity: gRPC/REST endpoint specifications
- Data Flow Visibility: End-to-end processing pipeline understanding
- Integration Patterns: External service communication protocols

For Operations Teams:
- Deployment Understanding: Kubernetes resource requirements
- Monitoring Setup: Health check endpoints and metrics collection
- Troubleshooting Guide: Error handling and resilience patterns
- Security Compliance: Authentication, authorization, and audit trails

This comprehensive architectural documentation significantly improves CDC infrastructure understanding, enables faster development cycles, reduces operational incidents, and supports better architectural decisions across the entire CDC ecosystem.

Benefits achieved:
- Onboarding Efficiency: New team members understand system faster
- Cross-Team Collaboration: Shared understanding across development, operations, and security
- Decision Making: Clear architecture visualization supports technical decisions
