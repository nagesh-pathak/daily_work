title CDC Flow API Service - Status State Machine

' Define states
[*] --> Intermediate : New flow created

state "Intermediate" as interm {
  state "No data" as no_data
  state "Starting" as starting
  
  no_data -right-> starting : Pod creation initiated
}

state "Active" as active {
  state "Normal operation" as normal
  state "Data flowing" as flowing
  
  normal -down-> flowing : Events processed
}

state "Inactive" as inactive {
  state "Error state" as error
  state "Connection failure" as conn_fail
  
  error -left-> conn_fail : Connection lost
}

' Define transitions
interm --> active : Recent timestamps,\nNo errors
active --> inactive : Error count > 0 or\nConnection issue
inactive --> active : Error resolved,\nConnection restored
inactive --> interm : Service restarted

' Define notes
note bottom of interm
  <b>Intermediate State</b>
  - New flow or service starting
  - No metric data available
  - Default state after creation
  - No timestamp data yet
end note

note right of active
  <b>Active State</b>
  - Normal operation
  - Recent timestamps from both source and destination
  - No errors reported
  - Data is flowing through the pipeline
end note

note left of inactive
  <b>Inactive State</b>
  - Error count > 0
  - Connection issues detected
  - Failed to send/receive data
  - Requires intervention
end note

' Status determination logic
note "Status Determination:\n\nflow.Status = determineFlowStatus(dstHealthStatus, sourceHealthStatus)" as logic
