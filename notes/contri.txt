1. Allow mulitple flow to same destination ip and destination type
Added functionality so that customers should be able to create multiple number
of flows to same destiantion ip , and also to different ip but same destination type
from NIOS source


2. Create observability for cdc(cloud data connector) infrastructure

Build A unified monitoring dashboard for CDC OnPrem infrastructure

Created real-time monitoring for CPU, Memory, and Disk usage with configurable thresholds
Along with alert system which ensures proactive monitoring, rapid incident response, and maintaining 
high service availability across the entire CDC OnPrem infrastructure, supporting both operational teams and customer SLA requirements
Implemented trend analysis for resource usage growth
Built customer summary statistics showing:
Total CDC customers
Active vs Inactive hosts
BloxOne vs NIOS source distribution

created specialized dashboards for
Events monitoring
Flow status tracking

These improved CDC infrastructure visibility and enables proactive monitoring of resource utilization across the entire CDC OnPrem


3. Create SLI/SLO
Created SLI/SLO's which significantly enhances CDC operational excellence by providing structured, measurable, and actionable monitoring capabilities 
that directly support business objectives and operational requirements.
Established baseline metrics covering 50+ SLI indicators across CDC services

Reorganized metrics into 6 Business Services
CDC OnPrem Service: Infrastructure Monitoring, Host Management, Container Operations
CDC Flow Service: Flow Management, Data Processing
CDC Service: Customer Management, Service Health, Performance Monitoring, Feature Analytics
CDC API Service: API Performance
CDC Capacity Service: Capacity Planning
CDC Cloud Service: Container Health, Infrastructure Availability, Network Performance, Monitoring Operations, Operational Stability, Security

4. Create architectural diagrams for better understanding of the cdc components & services

Created the architectural diagrams for Usage & Impact for CDC Infrastructure Understanding

For Development Teams:
Clear Component Boundaries: Understanding service responsibilities
API Contract Clarity: gRPC/REST endpoint specifications
Data Flow Visibility: End-to-end processing pipeline understanding
Integration Patterns: External service communication protocols
For Operations Teams:
Deployment Understanding: Kubernetes resource requirements
Monitoring Setup: Health check endpoints and metrics collection
Troubleshooting Guide: Error handling and resilience patterns
Security Compliance: Authentication, authorization, and audit trails

This comprehensive architectural documentation significantly improves CDC infrastructure understanding, 
enables faster development cycles, reduces operational incidents, and supports better architectural decisions across the entire CDC ecosystem.
This will also help
Onboarding Efficiency: New team members understand system faster
Cross-Team Collaboration: Shared understanding across development, operations, and security
Decision Making: Clear architecture visualization supports technical decisions
