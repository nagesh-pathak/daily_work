==== CDC HA Dev Integration Plan ====

[x] Have setup ready in env-2a with two CDC hosts

[x] Create a flow with single host
[x] Update a flow with CDC HA by adding one service instance
[x] Update a flow by removing primary/secondary service instance

[x] Create a flow with primary & secondary
[x] Update flow by removing primary service instance and update destination
    Can't remove primary , only removing secondary is supported.

    Pod doesn't restart and config isn't pushed after swapping instances


[] Create a flow with all supported log types

[] Create multiple flows to the same destinations
[] Play with multiple flows to same destination by adding/removing flows and log types

[] data request should be done from active host always
[] grpc-in should be healthy always

[] Check the behavior in data-exporter-kafka when failover happens
[] Check data-exporter-kafka logs for any errors/warnings
[] Check data-exporter-kafka cpu/memory usage before/after

Log Monitoring for Errors/Warns/Fatal
    cdc-flow
    cdc-api
    data-exporter-kafka
    cdc-grpc-in
    <destinations-pods>

DB Monitorings
    [] Monitor migration pod and logs of that

Health Monitoring
    [x] health checks for cloud & onprem services

Metrics Monitoring
    [] event count metrics for cloud-to-onprem services

Configuration Monitoring
    [x] verify the configuraitons in grpc-in and destination pod
    [x] also check the configurations in cdc-flow/cdc-api databases

Data Monitoring
    [] Generate the logs and verify for the above combinations
    [] Make sure that switch is happening when failed over
    [] Verify that what is max switchover time

    [] Validate the case when both the hosts are unreachable
    [] Delete onprem pods and check the behavior
