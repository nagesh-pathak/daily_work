# CDC SLI/SLO Feature Reorganization Summary

## Overview
Reorganized the CDC metrics CSV file to use proper **functional features** instead of dashboard names, following the pattern established in `refer.csv`.

## Feature Reorganization

### ❌ **Previous Approach (Dashboard-Based)**
- Used dashboard names like "Disk Usage Dashboard", "CPU Usage Dashboard"
- Mixed technical implementation details with business features
- Not aligned with functional domains

### ✅ **New Approach (Feature-Based)**
Following `refer.csv` pattern where features represent functional domains:

## **CDC Business Services & Features**

### 1. **CDC OnPrem Service**
#### **Infrastructure Monitoring**

- Memory usage percentage & growth rate
- *Consolidated from: Disk/CPU/Memory Usage Dashboards*

#### **Host Management**
- Healthy hosts, Connected hosts
- Hosts not in Review Details  
- Hosts with adequate resources
- *Consolidated from: Host Details Dashboard*

#### **Container Operations**

## **Key Improvements**

### 1. **Functional Alignment**
- Features now represent business/functional domains
- Matches `refer.csv` pattern (Identity, AuthZ, Security, etc.)
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Logical Grouping** 
- Related metrics grouped under meaningful features
- Multiple dashboards consolidated into single features
- Easier to understand and maintain

### 3. **Business Context**
- Features have clear business purpose
- SLIs align with functional requirements
- Better for stakeholder communication

### 4. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new SLIs under existing features
- Clear feature boundaries for team ownership
- Supports feature-based alerting strategies

## **Feature Distribution**

| Business Service | Features | SLI Count | Focus Area |
|------------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **CDC OnPrem** | 3 features | 15 SLIs | Infrastructure & Operations |
| **CDC Flow** | 2 features | 8 SLIs | Data Processing & Flow Management |
| **CDC Service** | 4 features | 9 SLIs | Service Management & Analytics |
| **CDC API** | 1 feature | 4 SLIs | API Performance |
| **CDC Capacity** | 1 feature | 2 SLIs | Capacity Management |
| **CDC Cloud** | 6 features | 12 SLIs | Cloud Operations & Security |

**Total: 17 Features across 6 Business Services covering 50 SLIs**

## **Implementation Benefits**

### **For Monitoring Teams:**
- Clear feature ownership boundaries
- Logical SLI organization for dashboards
- Feature-based alert grouping

### **For Business Stakeholders:**
- Features align with business functions
- Clear understanding of monitored capabilities
- Better SLO reporting structure

### **For Development Teams:**
- Features map to service responsibilities
- Clear boundaries for metric ownership
- Supports microservice architecture

## **Next Steps**
1. **Validate** feature alignment with business requirements
2. **Create** feature-based monitoring dashboards
3. **Set up** feature-level SLO reporting
4. **Implement** feature-based alerting strategies
5. **Establish** feature ownership with teams

This reorganization provides a more sustainable and business-aligned approach to CDC monitoring and SLO management.
