[] Each service level error count for the selected date range
    [] Add pie chart for that along with table information
    [] Total Hosts (healthy + unhealthy)
        [] Hosts in Review-Details
        [] Healthy Hosts
        [] Host in disconnected state
        [] Hosts with CDC <= 4 cores and <= 8 GB RAM <= 128 GB Hard Disk
           [] Total number of CDC enabled Accounts
    [] Need more details about total RAM size, used size and %
    [] Same is required for memory and disk usage
           [] Container open sockets
            [] Stale flows [flows created, but ther is no data flow]

    Phase-1

        [] Disk Usage

            [] Disk usage > 50% (vs Total Disk Size)

            [] Disk usage tracking (> from last 3 hours)

        [] CPU Usage

            [] CPU usage > 60% (vs Total Cores)

            [] CPU usage tracking (> from last 1 hours)

        [] Memory Usage

            [] Memory usage > 50% (vs Total RAM Size)

            [] Memory usage tracking (> from last 1 hours)

        [] Flow Status

            [] We need total count and % w.r.t each status

            Count

                [] Total number of flows in "Review Details"

                [] Total number of flows in "Disabled"

                [] Total number of flows in "Pending Configuration Push"

                [] Total number of flows in "Online"

        [] How many customers enabled CDC and how many hosts ?

            - Need two things [one to show overall and another to show in table form w.r.t account filter]

        [] Move CDC Flow & CDC API from onprem-monitoring

        [] Add monitoring & Alerting for CrashLoopBackOff | ImagePullBackOff | Restart

    [] Phase-2
